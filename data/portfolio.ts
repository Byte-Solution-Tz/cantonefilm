      'This project documents the early progress of the Asia–Africa BlueTech Superhighway (AABS) across five countries in Africa and Asia led by WorldFish. Through a series of country-focused videos, the project highlights how small-scale fishing and aquaculture communities are being supported through improved data systems, climate-smart technologies, value addition, and more inclusive fisheries management, working closely with national institutions and local partners.',

      'We adopted a documentary-style approach, collaborating with WorldFish and in-country partners to capture real activities, voices, and experiences on the ground. By combining interviews, field footage, and contextual visuals, the videos translate complex research and development efforts into clear, accessible stories tailored to each country’s realities.',

    results:
      'The project delivered a coordinated series of five videos—one from each participating country—providing a clear overview of AABS’s early progress, partnerships, and direction. The videos serve as communication and knowledge-sharing tools for partners, donors, and wider audiences, supporting engagement and understanding across regions.',
